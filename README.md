# Website - [Little things that make us happy]((https://aarz1401.github.io/))
## Project Description
This website is designed to host my short film - _Little Things that make us happy_ . This film is inspired by little things all around us that 
have the potential to bring happiness in our lives when we pay attention to them. All too often, such things get ignored, but if we would be 
a little bit more attentive, we would appreciate them. 

The Theme of the website showcases stars, torches, meteors, the moon , falling leaves, and moving clouds in various sections. All of these are little
wondrous things - little not necessarily in a physical sense but in terms of the significance we usually assign them. However, upon reflecting a little,
we can start to understand how beautiful these really are.This is the story that I want to tell through the website. 

I wanted the user to experience a feeling of awe and happiness. The wonderful background of the milky way in the home section inspires awe. Details such as shooting
stars, moving clouds and a full moon draw attention to these things that we usually ignore. There is also a descriptive gallery of images that inspires the user
to pay more attention around them to look for such things and find beauty in them.
